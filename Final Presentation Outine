The average residential home loses 14% of its water to leaks. This amounts to about 22 gallons a day.  These leaks could cause
damage to your home and promote the growth of mold, costing you tons and putting your health in jeopardy. Water leaks account
for $9.1 billion dollars of property damage in a year.

Some water meters on the market do have leak detection mechanisms. This triangle here moves whenever water is being used. When
all the faucets are off, and the triangle is moving, then there is a water leak in the house. However, they are time consuming
to use and require the user be home and physically check the meter.

Hydroleak offers a unique automated system that will check and notify the user of any potential leaks even when the homeowner is
not home or not aware of a leak that has occurred. Our product is primarily targeted at residential use, but can easily be 
scaled for commercial applications.

Hydroleak uses a wifi-connected camera, which monitors this triangle and tells if it is moving.

Our plan is to have the user schedule off-peak times for the sensor to automatically check for leaks, as well as a “check now”
feature for real time monitoring.

  - Handed out flyers and posted online
  - Feedback:
     - Based on customer’s feedback, we added a web portal for notification of leaks, in addition to the smartphone app.
     - Modified the system to continuously monitor flow in water meter, instead of just recording it during a few times a day. 
       This can give some false positives if there is water flowing for more than an hour, but 
     - Implemented a system to also track water usage through the app or web portal.

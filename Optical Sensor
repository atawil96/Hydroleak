Very cheap, easy to use, and serves our purpose! Seems like a great product that would be able 
to sense the motion easily.
Works in Black and White and low resolution, programming is easy because no image differencing is needed,
it does motion tracking by itself.
Meant to colect data from close distances which is exactly what we need.

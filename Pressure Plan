Goal: Detect and warn user about leaks for an above-ground, constant diameter, horizontal pipe.

Method: Attach a pressure sensor on the beginning and end of the pipe. If the pressure at the end of the pipe is less
than the pressure at the beginning, the pipe is leaking.

Potential Improvements
1. Vertical pipe leak detection
  > Problem: Water pressure decreases with altitude. Water pressure decreases by approximately 0.433 PSI/foot assuming 
  g = 9.8 m/s^2 [1] (on earth: g is between 9.78 m/s^2 and 9.83 m/s^2) [2]
    - Solution 1: Allow the sensors to calculate their vertical distance from each other and thus, calculate the expected drop
                  in pressure.

2. Underground leak detection
  > Problem: Sensors cannot communicate well with wifi underground
    - Solution 1: Connect sensors together with wire so they don't have to use wifi. The sensor closest to ground level will
                  be connected to an above-ground box with wire. The box will collect the information and send it through wifi.
    
3. Variable pipe diameter leak detection
  > Problem: Pressure changes when the pipe diameter changes
    
4. Detect where the pipe is leaking
  > Problem: We don't know where exactly the pressure is decreasing between the start and end of the pipe.
    - Solution 1: Adding more than 2 sensors allows us to detect where the pipe is leaking. If the pressure is less at sensor 2 
                  than sensor 1, but constant between sensor 2 and sensor 3, the pipe is only leaking between sensor 1 and 2.

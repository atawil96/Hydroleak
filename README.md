EID101-D Project

Pressure system: Abandoned! (Used two pressure sensors at each end of pipe)

Camera system: Idea under consideration. (Use camera to track triangular leak detector on water meter)


Our current plan: Flow rate system (Flow sensor and flow switch. If flow is not zero, there's a leak)

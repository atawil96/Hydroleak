Use a flow switch and flow sensor.

A flow switch is a sensitive device (~0.1 L/min). It has a broken ciruit. When water flows through it, the ciruit gets completed and an
electric current flows. When there is an electric current, either someone or some appliance is using water, or there is a leak.

A flow sensor (~1L/min) will report the rate at which water is leaking, so the user can see how large the leak is.

The current plan for determining whether someone is using water or water is leaking is that we will have the user set a time, 
say 3AM, when they know that they are not using water for the device to check for leaks. 

However, the problem with this system is that it does not allow for real time monitoring. This means that if a leak occurs, the 
homeowner will not know until after the set time, which will usally be by morning. This is not a huge deal if the leak is small, 
but if a pipe bursts, you want to know right away. 

An alternate solution that is under consideration is to time the amount of time that there is water flow. We feel it is safe to
say that under normal circumstances, water will not be constantly on for more than an hour at a time. Of course the amount of 
time can be adjusted by the user. However, with a timer system, Hydroleak can constantly monitor waterflow and let the homeowner
know within a reasonable amount of time if there is a leak.

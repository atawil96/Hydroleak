Use a camera to track the triangular flow detector on current water meters. Turn off all water. If the triangle shows 
movement, there is flow, and thus a leak. 
Attach an LED to help see the triangle in the dark.

To set up for the first time, ask the user to place the camera right over the triangular flow detector.
Hydroleak will take a photo of the area when it starts, the original. Take the 2nd photo 1 minute later. Run both photos through
image differencing software. If there is no difference, there's no leak. Otherwise, there could be a leak. Repeat this process, 
setting the 2nd photo now as the original. Check if there's a consistant difference between photos.

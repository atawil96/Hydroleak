Use a camera to track the triangular flow detector on current water meters. Turn off all water. If the triangle shows 
movement, there is flow, and thus a leak. 
Attach a flashlight to help see the triangle in the dark.

To set up for the first time, ask the user to box in a specific area that contains the triangular flow detector to help the camera.
Hydroleak will take a photo of the area when it starts, the original. Take the 2nd photo 1 minute later. Set both photos to
50% transparency and overlap them. Compare this overlapped photo to the original. If there is no difference, there's no leak.
Otherwise, there is a leak. Repeat this process, setting the 2nd photo now as the original. Check if there's a consistant
difference between photos.

Original website: hydroleak.wix.com/detection
Pros:
-simple to design
-easy and free to use
-supports email response

Cons:
-does not provide website analytics
-only sends responses to email not google docs


Because of these things, we switched to brace.io which gave us both google anylaytics and google docs.

New webiste link: hydroleak.brace.io

Things we needed to fix on the website:
-incorporate the PROBLEM into the wesbsite and why our product is the SOLUTION
-add pictures of leaks and water damage
